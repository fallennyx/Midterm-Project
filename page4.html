<h1>Aftermath</h1>
<p style="font-size: 1.5rem; line-height: 2;">
        I sat there, in a state of pure happiness. I continued to play my video games. Unaware of what I
        just did. Soon, my little sister noticed there was no more chicken. She started to complain.
        She called my mom and snitched on me. My mother screamed at me on the phone for eating 3 days worth of protein.
        She then told all my cousins and aunts and uncles and anyone she could. I was referred to as Mr 15 chickens for months.
        If someone didn't know the story, my mom told them promptly. I was safe nowhere. Nowadays, she brings it up occasionally.
        But the legend of Mr 15 chickens will live on forever.
