    <h1>The Feast </h1>
    <p style="font-size: 1.5rem; line-height: 2;">During quarantine, my mom would cook alot of food to be used during the week. On one particular day, she baked chicke wings.
        The wings were seasoned and cooked to perfection. They overtook the house with such an aroma any human would have been mesmerized.
        Finally, the moment of truth arrived. My mom presented the platter of chicken wings to the family,
        their golden-brown allure glistening in the soft light.
        The wings were cooked to perfection - crispy on the outside, succulent and tender on the
        inside. It was a feast for the eyes, and my taste buds were already dancing with anticipation.
        I reached for the first wing, the crunch of its crisp skin beneath my teeth sent a shiver
        down my spine. The flavors that erupted in my mouth were nothing short of a culinary masterpiece.
        The wings seemed to melt in my mouth, leaving behind an explosion of flavors that
        I couldn't get enough of.
        My intention to eat only a few wings quickly faded into oblivion as I found myself lost in
        the culinary ecstasy. Before I knew it, I had devoured five, then ten, and finally, I looked down at
        the plate to see only the remnants of fifteen empty chicken wing bones.
